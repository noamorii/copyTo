# copyTo

## Description 

CopyTo is the web application that is served as a system for copywriting freelancers and website owners or administrators, magazine and magazine editors, and others looking for copywriters to edit articles and texts on their websites.

## Users

The application would offer two different types of accounts for copywriters and clients.

``Admin`` - the administrator of the website with access to all parts of the application, with the possibility of interventions in profiles, individual workplaces and orders, etc. The only restriction of access is to the communications of other users.

``Client`` - is a job-creating role for copywriters. He has the possibility to browse the profiles of copywriters with the possibility of reaching out, create new jobs and collaborate on the editing of texts, to which he can add comments and supply texts for editing.

``Copywriter `` - worker of the whole system. It has the ability to apply for a contract and work on them within the system.

Detailed functions of each role are included in the [documentation](https://github.com/noamorii/copyTo/blob/master/Semestral_work/Dokumentace/SRS%20-%20Copyto.pdf).
